# unity3D-DefenderBuilder-v2
An ongoing defender builder project that develops further from the builder defender prototype version 1.

<b>Version 2:</b> I'm currently working on a prototype that is inspired by the game `Shogun` developed by SEGA. It will include more gameplay functions (i.e. moving units by command, buildings that contain different unit types), A* pathfinding for units, etc.

<b>Features:</b>
<b>1. Build resource towers and collect resources:</b> There are different types of resources such as stone, crystal and wood. Based on the names of the towers, you can collect the according resources when you build the towers. The resources are collected faster when the towers are placed near the resource nodes (indicating by the + signs next to the tower when you initially place them)
