# unity3D-DefenderBuilder-v2
An ongoing defender builder project. 

<b>Version 2:</b> I'm currently working on version 2 of this prototype to include more gameplay functions (i.e. moving units by command, buildings that contain different unit types), A* pathfinding for units, etc. This version is inspired by the game `Shogun` developed by SEGA.
