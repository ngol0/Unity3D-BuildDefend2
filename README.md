# Build & Defense V2
An ongoing defender builder project that develops further from the builder defender prototype version 1.

This version is inspired by the game `Shogun` developed by SEGA. It will include more gameplay functions (i.e. moving units by command, buildings that contain different unit types), A* pathfinding for units, etc.
